proxy-switcher-panel
==============

This is a small change to tomflannaghan's proxy-switcher (https://github.com/tomflannaghan/proxy-switcher). The proxy mode toggle list has been moved from quick settings to the top panel.

## Installation

I recommend using the gnome extensions site but this is not always up to date. To get the latest version, do

    git clone https://github.com/tomflannaghan/proxy-switcher.git
    cd proxy-switcher
    make build
    make install
