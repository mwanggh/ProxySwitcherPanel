font-viewer pangram
===================

From version 2.29 of gnome-control-center, the string sample used in font-viewer
to display some various characters with the selected font in current language is
taken from Pango (pango_language_get_sample_string).

See http://git.gnome.org/cgit/pango/tree/pango/pango-language-sample-table.h to
check the string in your language, and open a bug against the Pango module in
Bugzilla to propose a string for a new language or fix an existing one.
